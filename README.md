# College-Management-System

Apache NetBeans: This is like a special tool I used to build everything. It helps to create the software and make sure it works well.
JavaScript Framework: Using a cool way of doing things in the system to make it look good and work smoothly.
MySQL: It's like a super organized way of storing all the important information securely. 
Java: This is the language I used to make all the parts of the system talk to each other and work together.

I made this because I wanted to make managing colleges easier for everyone involved. It's all about making things simpler and better! I'm excited to keep improving this system! Stay tuned for moreÂ updates!Â ðŸ“šâœ¨Â .
